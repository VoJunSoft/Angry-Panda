Using NeBD on Express server to save and retrieve information.

to do list: this app allows users to enter tasks and tasks' description/information. then the app uses Nedb and express server
to store the data with a unique ID and the date it was created. the app then displays a list of to do tasks and their 
corresponding data. Also, upon clicking the task header, the app will show the description related to the item clicked.

this project also include an animation JS file to display an animated motion using MOJS. This file is deactivated (not linked to the index file) 

Next update:
1. link the animated javascript file to the index.html file
2. add "capture image" feature: the user will be able to save an image to their tasks description
